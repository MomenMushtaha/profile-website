# Intro

I am an AI Engineer specializing in Advanced Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback(RLHF), primarily using Pandas in
Python along with other common statistical libraries. My first significant work experience was at Carleton University,
where my team focused on predicting the spread of COVID-19 in each neighbourhood in Ontario through machine learning
models and simulations. During that time, I contributed by documenting and developing add-on tools in Python and C to
enhance the visualization of my seniors' findings. My second relevant work experience was at Ericsson, where I developed
web apps that apply SQL queries to scripts using Pythonâ€™s Flask and React in JavaScript. I also created automated tools
and scripts to normalize, standardize, and perform various operations on datasets using scientific Python libraries like
OpenPyXL and Pandas. My most recent position is my current job at Micro1, where I train large language models (LLMs) by
prompting them to fail and then assisting in their recovery from those failures safely through feedback and response
refinement. My responsibilities include cleaning and refining datasets so that the model can effectively address the
user prompts provided.
